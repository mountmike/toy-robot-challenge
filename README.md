# Toy Robot Challenge
This repo holds my approaches to a classic programming exercise - the toy robot challenge. I wanted to try and attempt the challenge in different languages and/or frameworks so each subfolder 'version' contains a different angle to the problem.

## 1. Simple React App
I bootstrapped with Create React App and made a GUI focused solution where React handles most of the logic with state and conditional rendering.

I dove straight into this with little planning as I just wanted to get my hands dirty after a few days of job-seeking with no actual coding.

A few obvious themes/concepts (a grid & a robot) are prompting what will probably be the next version I try - a more Object Orientated approach to structuring the code.

## 2. Object Orientated CLI version
